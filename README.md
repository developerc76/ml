## Machine Learning

Machine Learning implemented in C, using only the standard libraries. 

More information can be found on [my website](https://developerc76.github.io/ml) and in the README.md file in [src/Linear](https://github.com/developerc76/ml/blob/main/src/Linear/README.md).

```bash
cd src

make

./ml

make clean
```

My current goal, is to add CSV support to the file parser, which is usually more common in ML datasets.
