## K Nearest Neighbors

1. Collect data

2. Scatterplot

### EXAMPLE: 

#### Movies: 
* Budget
* Watch time
* Rating

3. Find the k closest movies to that movie on the graph

Those k closest movies are the recommendations

### Notes

* Can only be used with quantitative data (numbers)

4. Classification: average of k nearest neighbors on the missing dimension

* k = sqrt(N)/2

* Computationally expensive

* Not trained, but learns from data

* Euclidean distance
